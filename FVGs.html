                      <h2>What Are Fair Value Gaps?</h2>
            <p><b>Fair Value Gaps (FVGs)</b> are zones on a Forex chart where price jumps quickly, leaving an "unfilled" gap between candlesticks. In Smart Money Concepts (SMC), they’re seen as imbalances—areas
                 where buying or selling was so aggressive that the market skipped over a range, not finding its "fair value."
                 <br>These gaps act like magnets, drawing price back later as institutions (smart money) seek to balance the market or fill orders..</p>

            <h3>Bullish FVG:</h3>
            <p> A gap below an upward move—price often returns here for support.   </p>

            <h3>Bearish FVG: </h3>
            <p> A gap above a downward move—price often returns here for resistance </p>

            <h2>How Do They Form?</h2>
            <h3>FVGs emerge from a three-candle pattern: </h3>
            <p>  <b>First Candle:</b> Sets the baseline (e.g., a small bearish candle).  
               <br><b> Second Candle:</b> A big impulsive move (e.g., a strong bullish candle) that skips a range.  
               <br> <b>hird Candle:</b> Continues the move, leaving a gap between the wicks of the first and third candles.</p>

            
            <h3>The Gap:  </h3>
            <p>  <b>Bullish FVG:</b> Space between the first candle's high and third candle's low.  
              <br> <b> Bearish FVG:</b> Space between the first candle's low and third candle's high.</p>

        
            <p> <h3>Example:  </h3>
                GBP/USD:  
                Candle 1: High 1.3400, low 1.3390.  
                Candle 2: Jumps to 1.3410-1.3440.  
                Candle 3: Low 1.3430, high 1.3460.  
                Bullish FVG: 1.3400-1.3410. Price skipped this, creating an imbalance. </p>


            <h2>Why Do FVGs Happen?</h2>
            <h3>Institutional Aggression:</h3>
            <p> Smart money pushes price fast (e.g., after a liquidity sweep) to grab orders, leaving gaps.   </p>

            <h3>Inefficiency: </h3>
            <p>  The skipped zone didn’t see enough trading to balance supply/demand, so price revisits it later.</p>


            <h2>Why They’re Useful</h2>
            <p>  <b>Price Targets:</b> FVGs attract price like a vacuum—smart money uses them to enter or exit.  
                <br><b>Trading Zones:</b> They offer low-risk entries when price retraces, especially in the trend direction.  
                <br><b>Confluence:</b> They often align with order blocks or key levels, boosting their power.</p>

                <p>"OBs are"launch pads" where banks and hedge funds build their positions before pushing price up or down. In SMC trading, OBs are critical because they show 
                    where the big players entered, giving you a chance to ride their wave."</p>
