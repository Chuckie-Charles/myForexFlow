            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>FVGs highlight market imbalances where price is likely to return, while OBs mark where smart money (institutions) placed significant orders
                 before a big move. When these two align, you get a confluence zone that offers a low-risk, high-reward entry point</p>

            <h2>Why Combine FVGs and OBs?</h2>
            <p><h3>Confluence:</h3>An FVG overlapping an OB signals a spot where institutional accumulation/distribution (OB) meets a price 
                inefficiency (FVG), increasing the likelihood of a reaction.  </p>

            <h3>Precision:</h3>
            <p> OBs define the "where" (institutional entry), while FVGs refine the "why" (imbalance drawing price back).  </p>

            <h3>Smart Money Alignment:</h3>
            <p>Trading this combo lets you piggyback on institutional intent with tighter setups.</p>

            <h2>How FVGs and OBs Work Together<h2>
                <h3>Order Block (OB):  </h3>
            <p>The last candle (or small range) before a big impulsive move—where smart money loaded up.  </p>
            <h3>Bullish OB:</h3>
            <p> Last bearish candle before an upmove (support).  </p>
<h3>Bearish OB:</h3>
<p>Last bullish candle before a downmove (resistance).</p>
                        <h2>Fair Value Gap (FVG):  </h2>
                        <p>A three-candle pattern where an impulsive move skips a range, leaving an imbalance. </p>
<h3>Bullish FVG:</h3>
<p>Gap below an upmove (support). </p>
<h3>Bearish FVG:</h3>
<p>Gap above a downmove (resistance).</p>
                                            <h2>Overlap Scenario:  </h2>
                                            <p>After an OB triggers a big move, the impulsive candle often creates an FVG.
                                                 Price later retraces to this zone, where the OB and FVG align, forming a hotspot for smart money activity.</p>

<p><b>Example: </b> 
    EUR/USD H4:<br>  
    Bullish OB at 1.1920–1.1940 (last bearish candle).  
   <br> Next candle surges to 1.1980, leaving a bullish FVG at 1.1930–1.1940.  
    <br>The OB and FVG overlap at 1.1930–1.1940—price retraces here and bounces.</p>
           
                                   <h2>Steps to Combine FVGs and OBs</h2>
                                   <h3>1. Establish Higher Timeframe (HTF) Bias (H4/Daily)</h3>
                                   <p>Use Breaks of Structure (BOS) or Changes of Character (ChoCH) to confirm trend direction.  
                                    <br><b>Bullish:</b> Higher highs/lows + BOS above a high.  
                                   <br><b> Bearish:</b> Lower highs/lows + BOS below a low. <br> 
                                    Example: H4 EUR/USD shows a BOS above 1.1950—bullish bias.</p>

                                    <h3>2. Identify the Order Block</h3>
                                    <p>On the HTF, find the last candle before a big move in the trend direction.<br>  
                                        Mark the OB zone (high to low of the candle).<br>  
                                        Example: Bullish OB at 1.1920–1.1940 before a rally to 1.2000.</p>

                                        <h3>3. Spot the Fair Value Gap</h3>
                                        <p>Look at the impulsive move after the OB. Check for a three-candle FVG:<br>  
                                           <b> Bullish:</b> Gap between first candle’s high and third’s low.  <br>
                                           <b>Bearish:</b> Gap between first candle’s low and third’s high.<br>
                                            Mark the FVG zone.  <br>
                                            Example: After the OB, price jumps, leaving a bullish FVG at 1.1930–1.1940.</p>

                                            <h3>4. Check for Confluence</h3>
                                            <p>Confirm the OB and FVG overlap or are very close (e.g., within 5-10 pips).  <br>
                                               <b> Add extra layers</b> Does it align with a Fibonacci retracement (e.g., 61.8%) or a liquidity zone (e.g., swing low)?  
                                                <br>Example: OB (1.1920–1.1940) + FVG (1.1930–1.1940) + 61.8% retracement at 1.1935—strong confluence.</p>
                                                
                                                <h3>5. Wait for Retracement</h3>
                                                <p>After the impulsive move, let price return to the OB/FVG zone, often after a liquidity sweep (e.g., sweeping stops below a low in a bullish setup).  
                                                   <br> Example: Price sweeps below 1.1900, then retraces to 1.1935.</p>
                                                
                                                       <h3>6. Lower Timeframe (LTF) Confirmation (M15/M5)</h3>
                                                       <p>Zoom to M15 for precision. Look for a reversal signal at the OB/FVG:  
                                                       <br> <b>Bullish:</b> Engulfing candle, pin bar rejecting lower.  
                                                        <br><b>Bearish:</b> Engulfing candle, pin bar rejecting higher.
                                                        <br>Example: M15 shows a bullish engulfing candle at 1.1935.</p>

                                                <h3>7. Enter the Trade</h3>
                                                <p><b>Buy (Bullish Setup): </b> Enter at the OB/FVG, SL below the zone, TP at the next liquidity<br><b>Sell 
                                                    (Bearish Setup):</b>Enter at
                                                     the OB/FVG, SL above the zone, TP at the next liquidity target (e.g., swing low).  
                                                    <br>Example: Buy at 1.1935, SL at 1.1915 (20 pips), TP at 1.1995 (60 pips)—1:3 R:R.</p>

                                                    <h3>8. Manage and Exit</h3>
                                                    <p><b>Move SL to breakeven at 1:1 R:R.</b><br>Exit at TP or if a LTF reversal (e.g., ChoCH) signals against you before TP.  
                                                        Example: Price hits 1.1995—trade closed, profit locked.</p>

                                                        <h3>Example</h3>
                                                        <p>Practical Example (March 04, 2025)
                                                            Pair: USD/JPY  
                                                            HTF Bias: Bullish (H4 BOS above 150.00).  
                                                            Setup:  
                                                            Bullish OB: Last bearish candle at 149.80–150.00 before a rally to 150.50.  
                                                            Bullish FVG: After the OB, price jumps, leaving an FVG at 149.90–150.00 (first high 149.90, third low 150.00).  
                                                            Confluence: OB (149.80–150.00) overlaps FVG (149.90–150.00), near 61.8% retracement at 149.95.
                                                            Action:  
                                                            Liquidity sweep below 149.70 (grabbing stops).  
                                                            Price retraces to 149.95, M15 shows a bullish pin bar.  
                                                            Buy at 149.95, SL at 149.75 (20 pips), TP at 150.55 (60 pips).
                                                            Outcome: Price bounces from the OB/FVG, hits TP—1:3 R:R.</p>
                                                
                                                
                                                        <h2>Tips for Success</h2>
            <p>Unmitigated Zones: Use fresh OBs and FVGs—mitigated ones (already filled) are weaker.  
                <br>Liquidity Context: Look for sweeps before the retracement; they often precede OB/FVG tests.  
               <br> Patience: Wait for all pieces (trend, confluence, LTF signal) to align.  
               <br> Risk Management: Keep risk at 1-2% per trade, adjusting position size based on SL distance.</p>

            <div class="quote-box">
                <p>"Combining FVGs (imbalance zones) with OBs (smart money entries) taps into this dynamic. 
                    <br>The OB says, “
                    Here’s where they started,” and the FVG adds, 
                    “Here’s where they’ll come back.” Together, they’re a cheat code for SMC traders."</p>
