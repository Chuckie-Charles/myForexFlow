                      <h2>What Are Order Blocks?</h2>
            <p>Order blocks (OBs) are specific price zones on a chart where institutional traders ("smart money") place large buy
                 or sell orders, setting the stage for significant market moves. Think of them as 
                the "launch pads" where banks and hedge funds build their positions before pushing price up or down</p>

            <h2>Why OBs</h2>
            <p>In SMC trading, OBs are critical because they show where the big players entered, giving you a chance to ride their wave.
                Bullish Order Block: Where institutions bought heavily before a rally—price often bounces from here later.  
                Bearish Order Block: Where institutions sold heavily before a drop—price often rejects from here later.</p>

            <h2>How They Form?</h2>
            <h3>Order blocks emerge from institutional activity:  </h3>
            <p><b>The Setup:</b> Smart money needs liquidity to fill huge orders without spiking the market. They often manipulate price 
                (e.g., via liquidity sweeps) to trap retail traders and grab orders at favorable levels. 
            <br><b>The Candle: </b> OB is the last candle (or small range) before a big impulsive move.  
           <br> <b>Bullish OB:</b> Last bearish/consolidation candle before a strong upward break.  
           <br> <b>Bearish OB:</b> Last bullish/consolidation candle before a strong downward break.
            <br><b>The Result:</b> This zone marks where supply (sells) or demand (buys) was absorbed, leaving an imbalance that price respects on retracement. </p>

            <h2>Why Are They Important?</h2>
            <p><h3>Institutional Clues:</h3> OBs reveal where the pros entered, hinting at their next move.  </p>


            <h3>Reversal Zones: </h3>
            <p>Price often returns to OBs, treating them as support (bullish) or resistance (bearish). </p>

            <h3>Edge:</h3>
            <p>Trading from OBs aligns you with smart money, not against them.</p>

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p> Pair them with liquidity sweeps (grabbing stops) and trend analysis, and you've got a solid SMC edge.</p>
